		<p> Salvador Dali was a Spanish surrealist painter, known for his bizarre and imaginative images that explored the subconscious mind.
            Salvador Dalí was born on 11 May 1904, in the town of Figueres, in the Empordà region, close to the French border in Catalonia, Spain.
           Surrealist Style of Art
           In the period from 1950 to 1970, Dalí painted many works with religious themes, though he continued to explore erotic subjects, to represent childhood memories, and to use themes centring on his wife, Gala. Notwithstanding their technical accomplishments, those later paintings are not as highly regarded as the artist’s earlier works. The most interesting and revealing of Dalí’s books is The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí (1942).
