	    <h2 tabindex="9"> Art History Course Introduction</h2>
        <p>
           This Art History course integrates the four components of 
           art study: art production, historical and cultural context, 
           critical process and aesthetic process. Students will be 
           able to identify and describe art from prehistoric times 
           to modern time. Throughout this course, students will 
           discuss various artworks, research artists, and 
           create documents and presentations demonstrating concepts learned.
    </p>
	  <h3 tabindex="10">What is the course about?</h3>
	  <p>Art history is much more than decoding secrets and symbols, 
	  it is about critical thinking and empathy, understanding how an artwork not only reflects an artist’s interpretation 
	  of their world, but what it says to you about our world now. This course is designed to build your confidence with visual art by demystifying 
	  the myths that keep many of us from truly engaging with a work of art. It is designed for both the absolute beginner and those 
	  with some art historical knowledge who want to take their practice of art history to new depths.
       </p>
	   <p> We will look at a wide range of images, time periods and cultures
	   to explore broad questions like: How is an artwork is made? 
	   What is depicted and why? And, who gets to say what it means?
	   The overall goal is to build visual and cultural literacy that 
	   can be applied in a variety of art contexts, 
	   from the gallery and the museum to the catalogue and the computer screen.
	   </p>
	   <h3 tabindex="11"> What level is the course and do I need any particular skills? </h3>
	   <p>This course is suitable for all levels.
         You should be able to follow simple written and verbal 
         instructions, demonstrations, hand-outs and health and safety information, 
         and an understanding of how to operate basics of Zoom microphone and camera.
