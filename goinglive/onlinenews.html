  <h1> The Right To Bear Arms </h1>
         <p>Society today is governed by a series of laws that have accompanied us since the beginning of what we can call a civilized society. Since the beginning of the laws in the United States, the Second Amendment, which allows people to use guns, has been successful and has kept the country safe, as it fosters a feeling of security. Therefore, taking into account that the use of guns has fostered security in the country, the matter is not to change or eliminate the Second Amendment, but to understand that the problem lies with the gun owner and the methods used to control who may or may not carry a gun. Instead of testing an already established right or trying to change the laws, the situation should be handled by establishing <strong>background checks</strong> on each individual before carrying a gun.</P> 
     <H3>The   <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-2/" target="_blank"> Second Amendment</a> </H3> 
        <p>The Second Amendment, the right to bear arms, was one of the many rights granted to American citizens by the Bill of Rights and is one of the many rights that every American citizen has. </br> <q>A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed</q> </p>
	  <H3> Barack Obama's Speech </H3>
         <p> Former President Barack Obama was aware of the problem with carrying guns, but he was also aware that the problem was and can be fixed without eliminating Second Amendment, but rather by taking measures to reduce violence. As Obama Said <q>But I also believe that we can find ways to <b>reduce gun violence</b> consistent with the <i>Second Amendment</i></q> </p>
        <H4> Main Points </H4>
         <p>As Obama, statistics, and psychology have shown the Second Amendment should not be eliminated or modified since the problem is not in the Amendment but in the gun carriers. If the United States wants to reduce the number of shootings, a background check should be done beforehand, to know the person's past and what they can do with the gun and not to eliminate a law that has been in place and working for years.</p>
